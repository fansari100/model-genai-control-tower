{"id": "MT-001", "transcript": "Advisor: Good morning, let's review your portfolio. Your current allocation is 60% equities, 30% fixed income, 10% alternatives.\nClient: I'm concerned about interest rate risk with my bonds.\nAdvisor: That's a valid concern. Given the current rate environment, I'd recommend reducing duration. We could shift from long-term treasuries to intermediate-term corporates.\nClient: What about my equity exposure?\nAdvisor: With your 10-year horizon, I'd maintain the equity weight but increase international exposure by 5%, funded from domestic large-cap.\nClient: Sounds reasonable. Can we also discuss the 529 plan for my daughter?\nAdvisor: Absolutely. She's 8, so we have about 10 years. I'd recommend the age-based portfolio option.\nClient: Let's set that up.", "expected_summary_topics": ["portfolio review", "interest rate risk", "bond duration", "international equity", "529 plan"], "expected_action_items": ["Reduce bond duration", "Increase international equity by 5%", "Open 529 plan"]}
{"id": "MT-002", "transcript": "Advisor: Welcome back. I wanted to follow up on our discussion about your retirement planning.\nClient: Yes, I've been thinking about it. I'm 55 and want to retire at 62.\nAdvisor: Based on our analysis, you'll need approximately $2.5M in retirement assets. Currently you're at $1.8M.\nClient: What's the gap plan?\nAdvisor: I recommend maximizing your 401k contributions - you're eligible for catch-up contributions of $7,500 on top of the $23,000 limit. Also, we should discuss Roth conversion strategies.\nClient: What about Social Security?\nAdvisor: At 62, you'd receive about 70% of your full benefit. Waiting until 67 gives you 100%. Each year of delay adds roughly 8%.\nClient: I'll think about the timing. Can you send me a projection?\nAdvisor: I'll prepare a detailed retirement income projection and email it to you this week.", "expected_summary_topics": ["retirement planning", "savings gap", "401k contributions", "Roth conversion", "Social Security"], "expected_action_items": ["Maximize 401k with catch-up", "Prepare retirement projection", "Analyze Roth conversion"]}
