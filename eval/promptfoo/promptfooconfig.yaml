        Advisor: Good morning, let's review your portfolio. Your allocation is 60% equities, 30% fixed income, 10% alternatives.
        Client: I'm concerned about interest rate risk.
        Advisor: That's valid. We could reduce duration in the fixed income sleeve. I recommend shifting from long-term bonds to intermediate.
        Client: What about the equity allocation?
        Advisor: Given your 10-year horizon, I'd maintain the equity weight but increase international exposure by 5%.
        Client: Sounds good. Let's also discuss the 529 plan for my daughter.
        Advisor: Absolutely. We should open that soon given the tax advantages.
